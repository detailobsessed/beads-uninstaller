# Todos

- if possible, get 100% test coverage. does bashunit support coverage reporting?
- if appropriate, add badges to readme
- the ultimate test:
  - create a ultimate-beads-uninstall-test branch
  - brew install beads
  - bd init in THIS PROJECT
  - commit everything
  - run the uninstall script
  - verify beads is completely removed
  - if it's not, fix the script and repeat the test
  - once it works, add tests to get coverage back up to 100%

- rename readme to README.md and update it fully
